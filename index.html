      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 26, 2025</p>
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to PineOrange. By downloading, installing, or using our mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. The App is published by Weconnect Nordic AB ("we", "us", or "our") in its role solely as publisher; the underlying app content and creative development are owned and controlled by independent third parties. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Publisher and Ownership Clarification</h3>
      <p>
        Please note that Weconnect Nordic AB acts only as the publisher of the PineOrange app. We do not own or develop the app or its creative content. All ownership rights, trademarks, and intellectual property related to the app are held by their respective owners.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that these Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Weconnect Nordic AB. If you are using the App on behalf of a business or other entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.
      </p>
      
      <h3>User Account</h3>
      <p>To access certain features of the App, you may need to create an account. You are responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</li>
        <li>All activities that occur under your account.</li>
        <li>Providing accurate and complete information when creating your account.</li>
        <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>When using the App, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>Refrain from using the App for any illegal or unauthorized purposes.</li>
        <li>Not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the App.</li>
        <li>Avoid interfering with or disrupting the App, its servers, or networks.</li>
        <li>Not upload or share content that is offensive, inappropriate, or infringes on the rights of others.</li>
        <li>Ensure that your participation does not harm minors or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Content Disclaimer and User Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        The PineOrange app is designed as a party card game that includes explicit texts, questions, and tasks intended for entertainment. Some game elements, such as challenges or "punishments" (for example, "take 4 sips"), are offered as part of the gameplay. These elements are entirely optional, and you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your participation and any consequences arising from engaging with such content. Weconnect Nordic AB, as the publisher, disclaims any responsibility for outcomes, damages, or injuries resulting from your use of the App or engagement with its content.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>
        The App and its original content, features, and functionality are protected by copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. You may not modify, distribute, sell, or lease the App or its content unless expressly authorized by the respective owners.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties—express or implied—including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Weconnect Nordic AB, in its role as publisher, is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App or engagement with its content (including explicit texts, questions, and tasks). Our total liability for any claims related to your use of the App shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the six months preceding the claim.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Weconnect Nordic AB and its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App, including any actions arising from explicit content or your participation in game activities.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account and access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App will cease immediately. Provisions that by their nature should survive termination—including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, and limitations of liability—will continue to apply. You may also terminate your account by deleting the App and discontinuing its use.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in Sweden, and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice through the App or by other means. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, please stop using the App.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be modified to reflect the parties' intent as closely as possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. If the provision cannot be modified, it shall be severed without affecting the enforceability of the remaining Terms.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Weconnect Nordic AB regarding your use of the PineOrange app and supersede any prior agreements, communications, or understandings. No modifications or waivers of these Terms shall be effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Weconnect Nordic AB.
